# Herdr HUD

Keep your agents working while you game. A draggable H button opens your Herdr
agents, recent output, and prompt composer above your desktop or fullscreen Space.

## Why Herdr?

[Herdr](https://herdr.dev/) keeps your coding agents in persistent terminal
sessions and brings their status together across computers. Herdr HUD puts that
setup behind a floating H, so you can read progress and send follow-ups while
you game. Run agents on your gaming machine or connect to a Mac/Linux computer
that hosts them.

Bring your own coding agent and its existing login. The HUD has no separate
account or model subscription; your agent's normal provider costs still apply.

**New to Herdr? [Start with the step-by-step setup guide](docs/getting-started.md).**
It covers installing Herdr, starting your first agent, connecting the HUD,
setting up SSH or Tailscale, adding computers, and troubleshooting.

## Download and install

For a first-time setup, follow the [beginner guide](docs/getting-started.md).
Already have agents running in Herdr? Install the HUD below.

Get the latest [alpha downloads](https://github.com/finna/herdr-hud/releases/tag/v0.1.0-alpha.1):

- **Apple Silicon Mac:** [Download Herdr HUD.dmg](https://github.com/finna/herdr-hud/releases/download/v0.1.0-alpha.1/Herdr-HUD-macOS-arm64.dmg).
  Open the DMG, drag **Herdr HUD.app** onto the **Applications** folder inside,
  then eject the DMG and open Herdr HUD from Applications. Requires macOS 13+;
  Intel Macs are not included in this build.
  The Mac downloads are **Developer ID signed and notarized by Apple**.
  macOS may ask you to confirm opening an app downloaded from the internet.
  If you downloaded an earlier unsigned copy, download again and replace it.
- **Windows 11 x64:** [Herdr-HUD-Windows-x64.zip](https://github.com/finna/herdr-hud/releases/download/v0.1.0-alpha.1/Herdr-HUD-Windows-x64.zip).
  Extract the whole ZIP into a folder, double-click **Install.cmd**, then open
  **Herdr HUD** from Start. The installer runs as your normal user. Keep all files
  together if running HerdrHUD.exe directly instead.
- **Omarchy Quattro:** use the existing [Omarchy plugin](https://github.com/finna/omarchy-herdr-hud).
  `omarchy plugin add https://github.com/finna/omarchy-herdr-hud.git --enable`.

Download from this repository and compare the release's SHA256SUMS.
The Mac app and DMG have stapled Apple notarization tickets and pass Gatekeeper
assessment. The **Windows package remains unsigned** and may show an
unknown-publisher/SmartScreen prompt; only proceed if you trust and have verified
this download.

Close the HUD and preserve drafts before installing an update. No agent servers
need to be restarted. To uninstall, quit the HUD, turn off its optional login
startup, and remove the app; on Windows also remove its Start menu shortcut.
Settings locations are documented below.

## Run on macOS

Requires macOS 13+, Herdr 0.9+ installed with an existing running default session,
and existing SSH authentication for any saved remote machines. No account,
model API key, Python runtime, Node runtime, or hosted service is required to
run the packaged app. Xcode command-line tools are needed to build from source.

- Click **H** to open or close the agents. Drag H to reposition it.
- **Command–Option–H:** toggle the agent panel.
- **Command–Option–Shift–H:** hide or restore the whole HUD.
- **Escape:** close the panel while keeping H visible.
- **Enter:** send a prompt to the selected ready agent.
- **Control–Enter or Shift–Enter:** insert a new line (Command/Option–Enter also insert a new line).
- The **H menu-bar item** has visibility, alternative shortcuts, launch-at-login,
  refresh, and quit controls. Login startup is off by default and remains unverified.
- Drag the roster divider to resize it. Visibility, position, view, and divider
  width are remembered. Prompt drafts are kept per agent while the app runs.
- Agents needing attention sort first, then working agents, then read idle agents.
- Each agent is a card, like the Claude app's session list: an icon colored by
  state, the title, how long ago its state changed, and your latest ask below.
  Hover a card for its workspace, machine and mode. Machines are only named in
  the header while one is offline.
- H shows the most urgent state: a red ring and badge count agents that need input,
  otherwise a blue badge counts unread results. An amber arc turns while any agent works.
- Silent alerts appear above H (below it near the top edge) after an agent finishes or needs input.
  Needs-input alerts are red and stay until opened or dismissed; finished alerts are blue and fade
  after 6 seconds unless hovered. Several at once become one summary, which updates in place.

## Run on Windows

Requires Windows 11 x64 for the currently tested build, Microsoft Edge WebView2
Runtime, and either local Herdr 0.9+ or SSH access to an existing Mac/Linux Herdr setup.
The build includes its .NET runtime. Node and a .NET SDK are not needed to run it.
Windows 10 and ARM64 are untested.

Open **Herdr HUD** from Start. Right-click the tray H and choose **Herdr connection**.
Leave the SSH target blank to use this PC's Herdr installation, or enter your
existing Mac/Linux SSH target and session. In SSH-source mode, the HUD reads that
host's saved Herdr machines and accesses them through the source host, using its
existing SSH aliases and credentials. It does not copy private keys or enroll
machines. Root and saved-host authentication must already work without prompts.

- **Ctrl+Alt+H:** open/close the agent panel.
- **Ctrl+Alt+Shift+H:** show/hide the entire HUD.
- Alternative Ctrl+Win shortcuts and shortcuts-off are available in the tray menu.
- H is draggable. Escape closes the panel; Enter sends; Ctrl/Shift+Enter adds a line.
- Launch at login is optional and off by default. Quit from the tray menu.
- The panel can be resized from its right and bottom edges.
- Notifications appear above H (below it near the top edge) and follow it when moved.

The Windows package is currently unsigned. It runs as your normal user and uses
WinForms, WebView2 and native topmost windows. It does not inject into games or
install a driver. **Exclusive fullscreen is not yet verified.** A visible overlay
and focus return over a test window do not prove compatibility with your game.

Settings and private diagnostic snapshots live in `%LOCALAPPDATA%\Herdr HUD`.
The installed app lives in `%LOCALAPPDATA%\Programs\Herdr HUD`.
The executable supports the same basic `--open`, `--close`, `--show`, `--hide`,
`--toggle`, `--roster`, `--inspect`, `--snapshot`, and `--verify-ui` controls.
Results are written under its private support directory. `--fixture` briefly
creates a test window, clicks only that window and H, checks focus/order, captures
that display, and then restores the prior window and pointer. It is a development
test, not an exclusive-fullscreen game test. Do not run it during active gameplay.

## Herdr connection

For commands and examples, see [connecting the HUD](docs/getting-started.md#install-and-connect-the-hud)
and [adding more computers](docs/getting-started.md#add-more-computers).

The app reads `herdr machine list --json` from your existing installation. It
lists the local default session and enabled saved SSH machines, respecting each
remote profile's named session. It does not enroll machines, create teams,
restart Herdr, or install/update anything on remote computers. Machine discovery
is one level deep, matching the host's configured Herdr machines.

Local Herdr is located in its standard user or Homebrew install, then on PATH.
Remote reads and sends use installed SSH with existing configuration, batch
mode, and strict host-key checking. Herdr must be available in its standard
remote user install, Homebrew path, or login PATH. Remote Mac/Linux hosts need Python 3 for a small, standard-library-only prompt
helper. It runs over SSH without installing files and forwards text from stdin
to the host’s Herdr socket. Local Mac/Windows prompts use native socket/pipe
clients and do not require Python. Complete authentication and
host-key setup in Herdr first; the HUD does not open hidden SSH questions.

The roster updates from Herdr's event stream instead of polling. For each machine
the HUD keeps one read-only bridge (`watch.py`, standard library only) running
locally or over one long-lived SSH connection; it subscribes to Herdr's status
and lifecycle events and never sends input. A machine whose bridge is down is
polled every 3 seconds, an unreachable machine is retried after 15, 30, then 60
seconds without delaying the others, and everything is reconciled every 30
seconds. The local Mac bridge uses an installed Python 3 (Homebrew or the Xcode
command-line tools) and is skipped otherwise; a Herdr running natively on
Windows is polled.

Agent identities include machine, target, session, pane, terminal, and available
conversation identity. Each read/send rechecks the identity; sends also recheck
readiness and the saved machine configuration. Busy/blocked/unknown/offline
agents cannot receive prompts. Missing machines keep cached cards marked offline.

Herdr 0.9 does not atomically bind a prompt to an expected terminal ID. A fresh
identity check reduces risk, but another client can still replace a pane between
check and submission. Sends are serialized and never automatically retried.
An ambiguous result retains the draft and blocks another send until the user
inspects Herdr and explicitly reconciles it.

Chat is a conservative formatting of recent captured Codex terminal output,
not full structured conversation history. Other agents retain Terminal view.
Native approvals/questions must still be answered in Herdr.

## Prompt privacy and output limits

Prompt text never appears in process arguments or SSH command strings. It travels
over stdin across each SSH hop, then through Herdr's local socket API. The native
hosts and remote helper recheck the expected agent and validate acknowledgements.
Unknown delivery is never retried automatically.

Native command output is streamed with a 1 MiB stdout and 64 KiB stderr limit,
with 12-second Mac / 15-second Windows deadlines. Mac commands start in their own
process group; Windows commands are created suspended, assigned to a kill-on-close
Job Object, then resumed. Timeout or overflow terminates the owned group/job,
including descendants. The remote helper caps socket replies at 1 MiB and status
output at 64 KiB, and has a 12-second deadline. Prompts are limited to 60 KB.

## Architecture

- `Sources/HerdrHUD/App.swift`: AppKit nonactivating panels, fullscreen Spaces,
  menu-bar controls, Carbon shortcuts, monitor positioning, and WebKit bridge.
- `Sources/HerdrHUD/Transport.swift`: bounded process groups and native socket prompts.
- `Sources/HerdrHUD/Herdr.swift`: saved machine
  discovery, cached roster, fresh identity/readiness checks, literal SSH quoting.
- `Sources/HerdrHUD/Resources/`: reusable UI and transcript/attention logic.
- `Windows/`: native Windows shell, WebView2 bridge, and local/SSH-source transport.
- No HTTP listener, browser credentials, third-party model connection, telemetry,
  Squad integration, or tablet interface is included.

Only bundled files are loaded in the WebView. Its content security policy blocks
network requests. Terminal output is rendered as text, never executable HTML.
UI requests use a narrow native operation allowlist and main-frame checks.

Preferences use the `org.herdr.community.hud` defaults domain. Diagnostics and
explicitly requested panel snapshots live in `~/Library/Application Support/Herdr HUD/`.
Snapshots contain private agent output; do not include them in public releases.
The app itself requires neither Accessibility nor Screen Recording permission.
Those permissions may be needed by external tools to verify gameplay interactions.

## Build from source

These steps are for developers. Downloaded apps do not require the build tools.
Run commands from a clone of this repository.

### macOS build

Install Xcode command-line tools, then:

```sh
scripts/build-app.sh
mkdir -p ~/Applications
cp -R 'dist/Herdr HUD.app' ~/Applications/
open "$HOME/Applications/Herdr HUD.app"
```

Local builds default to ad-hoc signing. Published Mac downloads use Developer ID
signing and Apple notarization. Broader hardware/game verification remains future
release work.

To build a drag-to-Applications disk image locally, run
`scripts/package-macos-dmg.sh`. It creates a DMG in `dist/` with the app and an
Applications shortcut. By default this development package is also ad-hoc signed;
changing the download format does not remove Gatekeeper warnings. Maintainers can
prepare a signed and notarized DMG using the [macOS release guide](docs/macos-release.md).

### Windows build

To build with the .NET 10 SDK installed:

```powershell
powershell -NoProfile -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File ./scripts/build-windows.ps1
powershell -NoProfile -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File ./scripts/install-windows.ps1
```

## Checks

```sh
swift test
node --test Tests/*.test.cjs
node --check Sources/HerdrHUD/Resources/app.js
python3 Tests/test_prompt_helper.py
python3 Tests/test_watch_bridge.py
```

`HERDR_BIN=/path/to/herdr python3 Tests/test_watch_bridge.py` also runs the event
bridge against a real Herdr server that the test starts in a temporary home.

Node is needed only for JavaScript development tests; Python 3 is used by socket
fixtures and remote-helper tests during development. Swift tests exercise
identity changes, readiness, argument quoting, ambiguous delivery, large output,
saved-machine removal, offline caching, and reconnects with controlled transports.
They do not prompt active user agents.

With the app running:

```sh
"$HOME/Applications/Herdr HUD.app/Contents/MacOS/HerdrHUD" --open
```

The executable also supports `--close`, `--show`, `--hide`, `--toggle`,
`--roster` (read-only live JSON), `--inspect`, and `--snapshot` (own panel only).
`--verify-ui` checks live local/remote reads, draft retention, view switching,
search, text safety, and layout without sending prompts. It requires both hosts.

`scripts/fullscreen-probe.swift` creates an isolated temporary fullscreen window,
opens the HUD, records the window order and foreground application, closes the
fixture, and restores the prior app. Its evidence is stored under `.evidence/`.
This verifies macOS fullscreen window behavior, not actual gameplay or mouse input.

## Release boundary

Mac and Windows alpha. Verify real games, pointer/keyboard focus return, drag across
monitors, alert interactions, physical shortcuts, login startup, and restart
behavior before broad release. Intel Macs and older macOS releases are untested.
Windows exclusive fullscreen and other Linux compositors require further work
and game tests; ordinary always-on-top flags alone are not the release criterion.
